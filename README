HolmMHD has the following requirements:

    make
    Fortran 90 compiler
    HDF5
    MPI

Compile the code by executing

    make

in the main directory. Then run HolmMHD with

    mpirun -np <NUMBER OF NODES> ./bin/HolmMHD

The parameters are set in the file parameters.f90 in the ./src directory. The initialisation is set in the file initialise.f90 in the ./src directory.
The code requires the folders src, bin, obj, and data in the main directory.
